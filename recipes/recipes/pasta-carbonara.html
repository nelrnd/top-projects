    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta Carbonara is a classic Italian dish originating from Rome, renowned for its creamy, savory flavor and simple ingredients. The dish typically features spaghetti or another type of pasta, tossed in a rich sauce made from eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and freshly ground black pepper. The sauce is given depth with the addition of guanciale, a cured Italian pork cheek or jowl, which is saut√©ed until crispy, adding a salty, umami-rich component to the dish. When the hot pasta is combined with the egg mixture, the heat gently cooks the eggs, creating a silky, glossy coating on the noodles without scrambling them. The balance of creamy sauce, sharp cheese, peppery notes, and savory pork makes Carbonara a comforting and indulgent dish that highlights the beauty of simple, high-quality ingredients.</p>
